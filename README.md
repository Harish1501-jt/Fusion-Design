Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate Mechanical Engineer with a strong affinity for CAD drawing, 3D modeling, and 3D printing. I thrive on transforming creative concepts into precise, functional designs and enjoy exploring the intersection between engineering and innovation.

My journey in mechanical engineering has equipped me with deep expertise in:

Computer-Aided Design (CAD): Proficient with industry standard tools to produce detailed and accurate technical drawings.

3D Modeling: Experience in developing models for prototyping and production, focusing on both functionality and aesthetics.

3D Printing: Skilled in preparing, optimizing, and printing models for rapid prototyping and product development.

I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and sharing knowledge with the engineering community. Through this repository.I aim to showcase my projects, contribute to open-source design, and help others who share similar interests in CAD, 3D modeling, and making things come to life with 3D printing.

Feel free to connect if you share the same passion or have exciting ideas to collaborate on!
